Code associated with analyses for Kapsenberg and Bitter et al. (2022). doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104677.

DEG_commands.R contains code for identifying differentially expressed genes from transcritpomics data. Raw .fastq files associated with this analysis are available on NCBI

qPCR_META.csv contains data for all candidates confirmed with qPCR. Significance of qPCR results reported in Kapsenberg and Bitter et al. was determined using a perm.anova and the log2foldchange data provided in this file.

AlleleFrequencyTrajectories.csv â€“ Raw allele frequencies for marker SNPs at genes under selection in low pH conditions on days 0, 6, and 26. Data used for generation of Figure 3A and Figure S2A.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18518744/192899398-e24a7c3a-ae7b-4499-806d-637a2bdff8cf.png)
